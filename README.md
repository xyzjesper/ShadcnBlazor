## What is ShadcnBlazor?

ShadcnBlazor aims to bring the developer-friendly, elegant, and flexible shadcn/ui component style into the Blazor ecosystem.

- **Familiar** – Staying as close to the original shadcn/ui concepts as Blazor allows
- **Easy to use** – Includes a Tailwind plugin to simplify installation and component setup
- **Components** – Shadcn's base components and in the future additional components ontop of the base components
- **Open for Contributions** – MIT-licensed and community contributions welcome
